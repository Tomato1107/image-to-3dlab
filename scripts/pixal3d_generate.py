"""End-to-end Pixal3D generation: image -> textured GLB, on a Mac or an NVIDIA card.

    python scripts/pixal3d_generate.py input.png output.glb [--res 1024] [--seed 42]

Wraps `trellis-cli` from `vendor/pixal3d-cpp` (raven38/pixal3d.cpp), a C++/GGML runtime
with Metal kernels on a Mac and CUDA on NVIDIA. Install it with
`scripts/bootstrap_pixal3d.py`.

**Why this port and not the PyTorch one.** `pawel-mazurkiewicz/Pixal3D-mac` loads ~22 GB of
bf16 weights before sampling and its low-VRAM mode moves models between CPU and GPU, which
frees nothing on unified memory. This one runs the same model from 8 GB of Q8_0 weights,
with real Metal flash-attention, and finishes in about 6 minutes where the PyTorch port
could not finish on a 32 GB machine at all.

**Single-view needs a camera.** Pixal3D conditions on pixel-aligned features projected
through an explicit camera, so `--sv-image` synthesizes a front gauge camera at `--fov`
(20 degrees by default). A pre-matted RGBA image goes straight in; anything else is cut out
with u2net first (~5s), because a background left in becomes *geometry* -- a grey studio
backdrop came back as two enormous white sheets either side of a fox's head. `--no-matte`
skips it, `--matte` forces it.

Note that an alpha *channel* is not a matte: Qwen-Image writes RGBA whose alpha is opaque
noise, and both this wrapper and trellis-cli used to read that as "already cut out".

Deliberately not `--pipeline-type 512`: the single-view weight family has no res-512
texture flow.
